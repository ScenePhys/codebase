Smaller R or larger n increases negative power, reduces |f|, and pulls the virtual image closer to the lens (smaller |q|).","Using the thin‑lens equation 1/f=1/p+1/q with p=100 cm and q=−54.55 cm, compute f and m; then compare to the symmetric lensmaker estimate f≈−R/[2(n−1)] with R=120 cm, n=1.2.","f≈-120.02 cm, m≈+0.55. Lensmaker gives f≈-300.0 cm; the simulation behaves as a stronger diverger than the symmetric‑surface estimate.",Two sign‑convention slips can make you report f>0 here. Name them.,Treating virtual q as +|q| or using the converging‑lens sign for a concave lens (taking f>0).

By what percentage did m increase compared to scenario 1 (m≈0.545)?","f≈-137.55 cm, m≈+0.73. Increase ≈34.4%.",What unit mistake would make your f ten times too small?,Mixing cm and mm (or cm and m) in p and q or in R for lensmaker—units must be consistent.

Qualitatively, how does stronger curvature change optical power and the virtual image location?",Smaller R increases curvature → higher negative power → |f| decreases; for the same p the virtual image typically shifts closer to the lens (smaller |q|).,"For p=60 cm, q=−42.35 cm, compute f and m. Also report the symmetric lensmaker estimate with R=80 cm, n=1.2.","f≈-143.97 cm, m≈+0.71.

Why does a higher n strengthen the diverging action and move the virtual image?","Larger n increases refraction at each surface, increasing negative power, reducing |f|, and moving the virtual image closer to the lens (smaller |q|, smaller m).","For p=60 cm and q=−30.77 cm, compute f and m; then compute the lensmaker estimate with R=120 cm, n=1.6 and compare signs/magnitudes.","f≈-63.16 cm, m≈+0.51. Lensmaker f≈-100.0 cm (both negative; magnitudes differ due to shape/thickness details).",What n‑related mistake would reverse the trend with f when using lensmaker?,Using (1−n) instead of (n−1) in 1/f∝(n−1); that would flip the sign of f.
4,concavelens_scenario_id_5_difficulty_moderate_.mp4,5,Edge case: at infinity,moderate,100,1.5,80,1160,-100.0,-100.0,0.08,"With parallel rays (object at infinity), explain why a concave lens has a virtual focus and cannot form a real image.","Diverging lenses make rays diverge as if from a point on the object side; the focus is virtual (f<0), so no real convergence occurs.","Estimate the focal length from lensmaker for R=100 cm, n=1.5 and report q when p→∞.","f≈-100.0 cm (negative), and with p→∞ we have q=f≈-100.0 cm.",How could a screen placement error mislead you into thinking a real image exists?,Placing the screen on the wrong side or mistaking a bright virtual ghost as a focused spot; virtual images cannot be caught on a screen.

How does changing p (not D) control magnification and image drift?","Magnification depends on geometry via −q/p; as p decreases, −q/p increases and the virtual image appears larger and closer to the lens on the object side.","Compute f and m for p=40 cm, q=−28.57 cm. Comment on how m compares to scenario 4 (m≈0.513).","f≈-99.98 cm, m≈+0.71, which is larger than 0.513 because the object is closer to the lens.",What confusion about aperture D could incorrectly change your computed f?,"Using D in the thin‑lens equation—D affects brightness/aberration, not 1/f=1/p+1/q; f is set by geometry and material, not aperture."

What trade‑off does reducing D introduce for virtual images?,"Narrower aperture reduces brightness and diffraction blur but can reduce spherical aberration; the image position (q, f) doesn’t change, only quality.","With p=60 cm, q=−37.50 cm, compute f and m. What remains invariant if only D changes?","f≈-100.0 cm, m≈+0.62. The Gaussian image position (q) and f remain invariant; only brightness/blur change with D.",Name one analysis and one experimental error tied to D that could be misattributed to focal length changes.,"Analysis: assuming D enters 1/f.

Explain why these match scenario 7 despite different D.","f≈-100.0 cm, m≈+0.62. D does not enter 1/f=1/p+1/q, so q and m are identical to #7.",What mistake would make scenario 7 and 8 yield different f values in your spreadsheet?,"Accidentally pasting different p or q, or rounding q to different precision; D should not be used in the thin‑lens calculation."
